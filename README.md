# Analysis-of-Sort-Algorithms

The goal is to compare and analyze sort algorithms from the perspectives of time complexity and actual execution time respectively.

Here we emphasize on three sort algorithms: insertion sort, selection sort, and merge sort. 

For each algorithm, explainining the time complexity in the average case, worst case, and best case.

Then run the programs for various input sizes (N), for example, 100,200,300,..., 10000 and measure running time T(N).

Plot running time T (N) vs. input size N.

Note: Also, analyzed the bubble sort.
